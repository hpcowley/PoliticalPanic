They love to champion an America that says “I’ve got mine, the rest of you are on your own” — but this doesn’t seem apply to giant corporations who get their handouts. Take what’s happening in Congress right now: Republicans are demanding we pinch pennies on programs like food assistance and health care for families. But next month, they want to roll out a plan that hands trillions in tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthy. I’m done being surprised at their hypocrisy, but I’m not done fighting back. Simply put, the rules work differently for different groups of people — and I’m doing everything in my power to put a stop to this rigged system and change this. Will you pitch in $15 or anything you can to power this fight before our midnight fundraising deadline tonight? I’m running for re-election to continue to use my voice to advocate for big, structural changes that actually help working people. But I can’t do this without your support. [[link removed]] I never expect you to donate to every email, but I wanted to ask before our important monthly fundraising deadline tonight at midnight, in case a financial contribution would make sense for you right now. I’m always grateful to fight alongside you.
