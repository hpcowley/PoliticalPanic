0,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1064260,Elizabeth Warren,I’m done being surprised,"May 31, 2023 11:28 PM","Congressional Republicans love to preach a “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality — until they’re talking to a billionaire. They love to champion an America that says “I’ve got mine, the rest of you are on your own” — but this doesn’t seem apply to giant corporations who get their handouts. Take what’s happening in Congress right now: Republicans are demanding we pinch pennies on programs like food assistance and health care for families. But next month, they want to roll out a plan that hands trillions in tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthy. I’m done being surprised at their hypocrisy, but I’m not done fighting back. Simply put, the rules work differently for different groups of people — and I’m doing everything in my power to put a stop to this rigged system and change this. Will you pitch in $15 or anything you can to power this fight before our midnight fundraising deadline tonight? I’m running for re-election to continue to use my voice to advocate for big, structural changes that actually help working people. But I can’t do this without your support. [[link removed]] I never expect you to donate to every email, but I wanted to ask before our important monthly fundraising deadline tonight at midnight, in case a financial contribution would make sense for you right now.

1,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1062765,Elizabeth Warren,I wouldn’t ask if it weren’t powerfully important,"May 30, 2023 10:36 PM","I’m running for re-election because there’s a lot we’ve got to do in order to save our country from extremists and make real change for our working families. And I’m going to keep fighting my heart out for this. Here’s a few of the ideas I believe in: We need to pass a wealth tax. Supreme Court Justices should follow a basic code of ethics. Quality child care should not eat up an entire paycheck. Big bank executives should not be able to gamble with consumers’ livelihoods. The filibuster must be abolished so we can pass the laws that the majority of Americans are calling for, like protecting abortion rights and enacting gun safety laws. If you’re with me, will you pitch in to support my re-election today? In order to run our campaign for these plans, we need to hit our monthly fundraising goals, and we’ve got an important one coming up tomorrow. So please pitch in $15 or anything you can so I can keep up this fight in the Senate.

But when we organize, hold those in power accountable, and fight righteous fights, we can continue to make positive change. Additionally, the special interests we’re up against will use our fundraising results to gauge what they’re up against. So how about we give them something to worry about?

2,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1061340,Elizabeth Warren,"When a letter came from one of my brothers, the day was extra-sunny","May 29, 2023 2:55 PM","My first memory of my oldest brother, Don Reed, is like a five-second home-movie fragment that plays in my head. It’s 1953. He’s nineteen; I’m three. We’ve driven to Oklahoma City, where he will report for duty to the Air Force. My mother and I are standing close together on a sidewalk, her full cotton skirt blowing around me. She’s crying. He’s halfway up some steps when he turns. Squinting in the blisteringly bright Oklahoma sun, he waves and gives us a quick wink. Then the memory is over. Six days a week, my mother rushed to the mailbox to see if there was a letter from Don Reed — or later on, from my brother John or my brother David, after each of them went off to the military. When a letter came from one of the boys, the day was extra-sunny. She would read it and re-read it and call my aunts or my grandmother to read it again over the phone. My brothers all made it home safely, and for that, I’m eternally grateful. Growing up with brothers in the military gave Memorial Day a special meaning: Understanding what others have lost and honoring even more the sacrifice of those who died in service to our country and those who love them. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid. In Washington, I’ll keep pushing our government to make decisions in the best interest of our service members, their families, and our national security. To take care of our veterans when they come home. To say no to forever wars. No matter how you honor Memorial Day, I hope you have a meaningful day.

4,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1057151,Elizabeth Warren,re: Katie Porter,"May 24, 2023 6:33 PM","As a law professor, I had the privilege of getting to know so many brilliant, hardworking students over the years. And now I have the honor of supporting one of them for U.S. Senate. Her name is Katie Porter. Maybe you’ve seen how she wields a whiteboard. Maybe you’ve heard the tough questions she asks Wall Street CEOs. And maybe you’re ready to help send this courageous champion to the Senate, so she can keep fighting for families in California and across the country. Can you split a donation of $15 or any amount between Katie Porter’s campaign and our re-election today? Katie’s in a competitive primary, and neither of us take any money from corporate PACs, federal lobbyists, or executives from Big Oil, Big Pharma, or Wall Street Banks — grassroots supporters like you help keep us in the fight. [[link removed]] If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process automatically: DONATE NOW: $10 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $15 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $28 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $50 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $100 [[link removed]] OTHER AMOUNT [[link removed]?] > I still remember the day when I met Katie. My consumer law class was early in the morning, meaning a lot of students had their heads down, trying to avoid being called on. But not Katie. She was determined and ready to go. When the first answer she gave wasn’t her strongest, she came to my office hours and said, “Please keep calling on me. I am going to learn to do this.” Getting to know her, I saw her bone-deep commitment to making a difference in people’s lives. Years later, then-Attorney General of California Kamala Harris secured a settlement of $18 billion from our country’s biggest banks for their predatory lending practices. She called me asking if I knew anyone who could serve as an “independent monitor” and make sure the big banks paid up. I recommended Katie for this massive undertaking, and boy did she deliver. She served as a watchdog over Wall Street banks, held their feet to the fire, and ensured California families received the billions they were owed. When Katie decided to run for Congress in 2018, I was very happy to support her. I knew that we needed more people like her in Washington — who understood the real experiences that working families faced, who had the courage to stand up to big corporations and special interests, and who would fight to make our government work for everyone, not just the rich and powerful. A Democrat hadn’t represented her district for decades, but she knew exactly how to personally connect with voters, build a strong movement, and win. She flipped that seat, and she’s been winning for working people ever since. Simply put, Katie delivers. She’s smart and she isn’t afraid. She stands up to Wall Street and Big Pharma, she holds fossil fuel companies accountable, and she fights to protect our rights. She is exactly who Californians need as their next senator, and I’m very happy to support her. We need her (and her whiteboard) in the Senate. She’s running a people-powered campaign just like ours, and I’d be so grateful if you could split a $15 donation between our campaigns today to support our fight for working families in the Senate. Every dollar makes a difference as Katie builds her grassroots team.

5,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1056436,Elizabeth Warren,We should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether.  It serves no purpose.,"May 23, 2023 11:16 PM","You know, I’d like to think that politicians run for office to help people. But the GOP doesn’t seem to be interested in that. They tout how they fight for the everyman. But that isn’t really true — at all. As we continue to plummet towards the June 1 deadline to raise the debt ceiling, the House GOP’s demands have shown that they’d rather take food and health care away from people who are struggling than take $1 more in taxes from a billionaire. They are threatening to push our nation off an economic cliff — and throw millions of hard-working Americans out of their jobs — if Democrats don’t agree to slashing programs like nutrition assistance, rental assistance, Meals on Wheels, and veterans’ health care. And at the same time, Republicans across the country are passing bills that take rights away from trans people, make it harder to access FDA-approved abortion medication nationwide, and control what our educators can teach at school. I am fighting back with everything I’ve got to make sure they can’t win — and I’m going to keep laying out big, bold plans that actually lift up working families and protect our values. But if Republicans gain more power, they’d have more free reign to pass their extremist agenda and block progress on the plans this movement is fighting for. Can you pitch in $3 today to fund my re-election campaign and support our progressive movement? A contribution helps show that our movement for big, structural change is stronger than their movement for extremist, harmful regression.

In fact, I suggested we should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether, because it serves no purpose — Congress already signs off on spending through an entirely separate process. But here we are. And Republicans are using this moment to hold our economy — and livelihoods of millions — hostage. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such drastic views from Republicans, and it won’t be the last. From the future of our climate to the survival of our democracy, so much is at stake if Republicans seize more power, and we must stop them. And we can — with a grassroots movement powered by grassroots donors. Every single donation helps strengthen this movement so we can push back against the GOP and pass our plans for big, structural change. And every single donation brings us closer to hitting our critical fundraising goals we need to hit in order to run this campaign. If you’re in this fight by my side, can you pitch in $3 or whatever makes sense to power this campaign and ensure we can hit our May fundraising goal?

Here are some of the plans that I’m fighting for: - Pass a wealth tax to make the wealthy finally pay their fair share. - End the filibuster to ensure abortion rights and enact gun safety laws across the country. - Significantly reduce the cost of child care for every American family, making it as low as $10 a day. - Rein in big banks and pass stronger regulations to prevent another economic crisis. - Make the Supreme Court follow a basic code of ethics. - Expand Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year and fully fund the program all the way to 2096. - Fast and free federal tax filing, so Americans don’t have to go through profiteering middlemen like TurboTax. (This is on its way!) - Crack down on corporate profiteering and price gouging so that working families don’t pay the price for their greed. - Ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning and trading individual stocks. We need to keep laying out big, bold plans that lift up working families and protect our values, and here’s the absolutely critical part: We need leaders who are willing to fight for them. I’m going to keep fighting with everything I’ve got — but nobody gets this done on their own. If you believe that these are the types of fights elected leaders should be taking on, please pitch in $15 or anything you can today to power my re-election campaign.

7,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1050817,Elizabeth Warren,Free tax filing is one step closer to being a reality,"May 17, 2023 9:37 PM","Sometimes, fighting for change feels like pushing a boulder up a never-ending hill. But if you keep going, and going, and going, you finally glimpse sunlight streaming over the top of the hill — and you know you’re making progress. Here’s an example of a fight where we just got some encouraging news: creating a free tax filing system. You see, for years and years, I’ve called out giant tax prep corporations for lobbying to keep it an expensive hassle to file your taxes. (Looking at you, TurboTax. You too, H&R Block.) But it doesn’t have to be this way. In fact, free filing has been implemented in many other countries. And I’ve urged the IRS to make free filing a reality — in legislation, in hearings, in letters, in explainers, you name it. People like you have raised your voices, too — in petitions, on social media, in messages to elected officials, and more. Last year, we took a big stride up the hill. Democrats included funding for the program in the Inflation Reduction Act, along with support for the IRS to crack down on wealthy tax cheats (another important boulder). And this week, we found out that the IRS will launch a pilot program for free tax filing next year, with room for the program to grow in future years. I’m going to stay on this and make sure Americans don’t have to waste time and money with big tax prep corporations. We’ve been pushing this boulder up the hill side by side. I’m deeply grateful for your partnership, and I wouldn’t be in this fight without grassroots support. Let’s stay in the fight and keep the good news coming. Can you pitch in $3, or any amount that makes sense for you today, to support our re-election campaign and help grow our grassroots movement for the big, bold reforms we need? This is how we make change.

8,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1047174,Elizabeth Warren,My mother,"May 14, 2023 2:04 PM","I hope you’re having a good Mother’s Day, and if this holiday hits you hard, my heart goes out to you. I’m thinking about my mother today, and I’m thinking about a time when she dug deep to take care of our family. After my daddy had a heart attack, he couldn’t work for a while. Bills piled up. We lost our family station wagon. It looked like the house would be next to go. At night, I’d overhear my parents talk, and that's when I learned words like “mortgage” and “foreclosure.” One day, I walked into my parents’ bedroom. My mother’s face was red and puffy. A dress was laid out over the bedspread — the dress that only came out for weddings, graduations, and funerals. ""We are not going to lose this house,” she kept saying. “We are not going to lose this house.” She’d never worked outside the home. She was terrified. But she knew what she had to do. She put on that dress, she walked down the street to Sears, and she got a minimum wage job that saved our house and saved our family. This Mother’s Day, I’m remembering her courage. I’m thinking about all the mamas fighting for their families. And I’m thinking about all the ways the deck is stacked against them: Today, a minimum wage job won’t keep a mama and her baby out of poverty. That is wrong, and that is why I am fighting to raise the minimum wage and put more power in the hands of working moms and working people everywhere — which includes strengthening unions. Most women who get abortions are already mothers. Many are working multiple jobs that don’t pay enough to support their children. Abortion bans make it even harder for those families to make ends meet. That is why I will forever be madder than hell that reproductive rights — and freedom to decide when and if to raise a family — have been ripped away, and why I’m fighting for the right to an abortion for anyone who needs or wants one. Without quality, affordable child care, mothers have been shoved out of the workforce, especially in the pandemic. They will feel the consequences — in lost earnings, in lower Social Security benefits — for the rest of their lives. That is why I am fighting for universal child care in our country. I’m going to keep up those fights, and more, like paid family leave, to honor my mother and mothers everywhere. And, look: I’m sure that social media right now is chock-full of Republican politicians waxing poetic about how much they love mothers. But I don’t want to see any tributes from them today unless they’re actually going to do something — anything — to improve the lives of mothers tomorrow. Thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement to make real change — to put our government on the side of mothers and families.

9,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1046387,Elizabeth Warren,"In Pennsylvania, early donations go the furthest to help plan for the long haul","May 13, 2023 1:01 PM","Didn’t it feel incredible to see John Fetterman get elected to the U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania last year? It was a hard-fought campaign, and this team pitched in to help make it happen. And next year, we’ve got a chance to win another powerfully important Pennsylvania Senate race: by re-electing Senator Bob Casey. We’ve got a lot of Democratic seats to defend, and we’ve got to defend this Pennsylvania seat as we fight to protect and expand our majority. Bob Casey recently launched his campaign for Pennsylvania — let’s make sure that he has the strong, early momentum he needs to win next year. If it makes sense for you right now, please split a donation of $3 or any amount between Bob Casey and our re-election campaign. [[link removed]] If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process automatically: DONATE NOW: $10 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $15 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $28 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $50 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $100 [[link removed]] OTHER AMOUNT [[link removed]?] > Whether it's been standing up to big banks, leading on landmark legislation for individuals with disabilities, or working to prevent campus sexual assault, Bob Casey fights for the people who need a fighter on their side. Recently, we teamed up to support rolling back the Trump-era deregulation of big banks like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. We’ve fought to make trade policy work for American workers. We investigated Postmaster General and Trump megadonor Louis DeJoy for sabotaging the mail during the 2020 election. And we can count on Bob Casey to stay in the fight for families. Bob Casey is a fighter for the middle class in Pennsylvania and across the country. We need to do all we can to keep him in the Senate. But I’ll just be blunt: this will be a tough battleground election. MAGA GOP operatives are already circling Pennsylvania like vultures, scheming to pick off Bob Casey and get that much closer to taking back the Senate. And you know the big banks and powerful special interests would love to knock him out of the game. Some of the potential Republican contenders so far: a former hedge fund CEO, and a guy who paid to bus Pennsylvanians to Donald Trump’s rally on January 6 — not to mention, who was at the U.S. Capitol that day. But no matter who the GOP throws into this race — even if it’s not a guy who can’t stop babbling about crudité — this will be one of the most competitive, most critically important Senate races of 2024. Early donations go the furthest to help plan for the long haul. Can you split a donation between Bob Casey’s and my re-election campaigns? Help defend our Democratic Senate majority, and help make sure we can keep up the fight.

10,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1046122,Elizabeth Warren,June 1,"May 12, 2023 10:46 PM","“X-Date” sounds like something out of a fantasy action movie — but it’s real, and it’s coming up fast. That’s the term people are using to describe the TBD date when the United States government won’t be able to pay its bills anymore — unless Congress takes action and raises the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently announced that the “X-Date” could come as early as June 1, which is less than three weeks away. The consequences of a debt default would be devastating. Millions of jobs lost. Our economy plunged into a recession. Countries around the world seeing the United States not live up to its word. Democrats are ready to prevent that nightmare scenario. We just need the Republicans to step up, do their jobs already, and stop trying to extort us into making devastating budget cuts. Now, I used to be a teacher, so I’m used to seeing students rush to get things done at the last minute — not that I ever called a deadline an “X-Date” on a syllabus. But there’s no reason for Congress to wait — and force Americans to twiddle their thumbs and wonder if we’re going to default or not. There’s no reason to let any doubt linger on the world stage about our nation’s ability to honor our obligations. And there’s no no reason why GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can’t immediately pass a clean bill to avoid a debt default — like the THREE debt ceiling increases he voted for when Donald Trump was president. Add your name if you agree: Republicans must get serious and stop playing negotiation games while Americans’ livelihoods hang in the balance. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] Now, look: I was saying last year that we needed to raise the debt ceiling before the Republican wrecking-ball crew took over the House. In fact, I suggested we should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether, because it serves no purpose — Congress already signs off on spending through an entirely separate process. But here we are. And we’ve got to navigate these choppy waters as best we can. Congressional Republicans are holding our economy hostage. They’re trying to use the debt ceiling as negotiating leverage. And you know what they want in exchange for not tanking the economy? Slashing programs like nutrition assistance, and rental assistance, and Meals on Wheels. Threatening veterans’ health care. Unwinding President Biden’s student debt cancelation plan. Look: if they want to talk about budget plans, we can have that conversation when it’s time to sign off on spending. But we can’t negotiate over whether the United States pays its bills on spending that Congress has already approved . I might add that the GOP blew up the deficit by handing massive tax breaks to billionaires and giant corporations — so if they really want to reduce the debt, they can by rolling those back. I’m staying in the fight to prevent a debt default and stop Republicans from making devastating budget cuts. I’m asking you to add your name, raise your voice, and say you’re in this fight, too. Together, let’s hold the line.

Take student loan cancelation for example. Cynics said we could never put our government on the side of working-class and middle-class people and get something like that accomplished. But we got organized, we got in the fight, and we got this policy to the president’s desk. I’ll stay in the fight to get student debt cancelation over the finish line. Because that’s a case where we still see how the rules work differently for different groups of people: Right now we have a system that holds millions of struggling student loan borrowers in limbo, but that same system worked overnight to ensure that big banks and billion-dollar crypto firms wouldn’t lose a dime in deposits during recent bank failures. The difference between these two scenarios? The willingness to fight for them. I’m running for re-election to continue to use my voice to advocate for big, structural changes that help working people. Changes like canceling student debt, taxing the rich, reining in big banks, and making child care affordable. But I need you by my side in this fight.

From moving forward with student debt cancellation to putting a new tax on greedy corporations, it’s been an honor to work with them — and they’ve shown what it looks like to have a government that works for working families, not the rich and powerful. So let’s have their backs. By signing up to be a part of the Biden-Harris campaign, you’ll say that you’re staying in the fight for a country that works for everyone. And you’ll say that you’re ready to defeat the GOP extremists who want to ban abortion nationwide, put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block, and give away the store to the wealthy and well-connected. Add your name here to get important updates on how you can get involved with the Biden-Harris campaign, and let’s support them side by side. I’m going to do everything I can to help between now and next November, and I look forward to continuing to work with them in their second term.

13,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1042494,ElizabethWarren.com,Elizabeth asked for your advice for the Class of 2023. Here’s what you shared:,"May 9, 2023 9:36 PM","Last week, Elizabeth sent an email asking supporters like you to share advice for this year’s graduating class. As she prepares to give a couple of commencement speeches this month, she reviewed your advice, and wanted to share a few submissions that stood out to her. Please forward this email to a recent or soon-to-be graduate in your life — or take some of the advice with you into your day! Keep reading and learning. Read everything you can get your hands on. Don't stop learning. Help all to have food, security, opportunity, love, and respect — this includes you. As an 8th grade teacher who has one of her favorite classes graduating this year, I would give this advice. Whatever particular plan you may have for your life, just remember that your country also needs you to step up and serve. Your curiosity, sense of fair play, and boundless talents are much needed by everyone around you. So whatever path you take, don’t forget to lend a helping and healing hand wherever you go! Start each day with the resolve to do the very best you can. Put aside yesterday's errors. Allow yourself a fresh start. Although pursuing a career and discovering ways to enhance it and take forward strides is important, it’s also important to live life. Much is learned from friend and family relationships. Juggling time can be tricky but rewarding as well. No one ever said there would be no frustration! Channeling energy in productive ways becomes a daily endeavor whether you are single or have 8 children! Take time to smell the roses and be thankful for the gifts. Look for the joy in everything. This outlook will make a world of difference in the outcome of your life. Next, take care of yourself first, as it’s like putting the oxygen mask on yourself first in the airplane. Lastly, be good to each other. It’s the little things that soothe the soul. A smile, a wave, opening a door for another, letting someone in while in traffic, sing a happy song on your voicemail. It’s the simple gestures that can change another’s life for the better. Congratulations. Please pay attention to who you are voting for in your local elections. Make sure they have your values on their agenda. Stay awake. Pay attention. Please vote. Wear Sunscreen. Do not be afraid to make mistakes because you will make them and you will recover from them. Forgive those who hurt you and forgive yourself. Do your best in everything that you do and do not be afraid to help others. Never underestimate the power of the individual to make a difference. Remember that for evil to thrive it just takes a good person to do nothing. Get out there, make a difference and take action even if you're the only one — stand proud and stand tall. Be involved with your town, city, state. Pay attention to what is going on in government. At your age, it may seem boring or unimportant, but it will affect you! Travel, see other cities and states, if you have the opportunity, go to other countries. Think outside the box and remember that perfection is highly overrated. Be yourself. Love yourself. I am a sixty-nine-year-old graduate student who is looking forward to graduating this year with my Environmental Science degree. It took me a long time to be able to finish one of my lifelong goals. But I am proud to be at the finish line. My advice to anyone who wants to pursue their goals, GO for it. Never give up. I had wanted to be a marine biologist but life chose another path for me. So here I am forty years later with a new degree and a new beginning to a purposeful career. Thank you to all of my professors who helped me on my journey. Remember to break down all your large complex and difficult problems into small tasks you can confidently handle and start doing them one at a time. All my best. Connect locally. Form connections with people you can see. Talk to them, whether they are retail workers or good friends. Form groups that meet regularly. It will ground you and help you keep your faith in humanity. It’s okay to not know exactly what you want to do in your career. Some of you may have known since you were three years old exactly what you wanted to be when you grew up — and some of you may still be completely unsure of where to go next. Focus on your values and your interests, and start somewhere that aligns with that. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Learn from that experience what you like and dislike in a career, then seek out the next opportunity that matches your interests a little bit more. Keep learning and growing, making changes. Maybe you stay in one field for five years and then completely change course. Maybe you find a new job every two years until you land in what feels like the right fit. That’s normal and part of learning and growing as a person. There’s no shame in figuring it out as you go — trust your instincts, remember that you deserve happiness and fulfillment, and keep moving forward. Vote. Get involved with organizations and groups that support your views and encourage growth. Keep reading. Keep asking questions. Don’t give up. You are the change we seek and our hope for a brighter, cleaner future. We hope you enjoyed reading those kind and thoughtful submissions as much as we did. Thanks for being a part of this movement.

14,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1039455,Elizabeth Warren,Do you have advice for the Class of 2023?,"May 6, 2023 2:03 PM","It’s getting to be graduation season, and I'm very happy that I'll get to help honor some terrific students this year by giving a couple of commencement speeches.As a former teacher and professor, I love commencement traditions. Students, parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, educators and loved ones all come together to celebrate tremendous achievements. And with hearts full of hope, graduates prepare to start their next chapter. It seems like every year we start with the obvious, and it’s true: This year’s class is graduating during a time of tremendous crisis. And with that I usually like to offer some simple advice for their next chapter: Focus on what you believe in, then fight like hell for it. But as I prepare to give these speeches, I’m curious: What advice would you give to this year’s graduating class? Please share your thoughts with me here. [[link removed]] SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS [[link removed]] I believe that every new generation in this country deserves more opportunity than the last — because I know the value of opportunity first-hand. From the time I was in second grade, I wanted to be a teacher (thanks to Mrs. Lee for telling me I could do it and changing my whole world). But for me to be a teacher, I needed to go to college. Back in Oklahoma, my daddy was a janitor, and my mom worked the phones at Sears. There was no money for college. Besides, my mother already had a plan for her only daughter. In fact, two plans: find a husband; raise some kids. I, on the other hand, had a different plan. I was a high school debater and I parlayed that into a full scholarship at George Washington University. But I didn’t follow the textbook on what to do with that opportunity. After two years, I dropped out, got married, and moved to Texas. Still, I never gave up on my dream of becoming a teacher. And thanks to a public college in Texas that cost $50 a semester (go Cougars!), I got my college degree and got to live my dream of becoming a public school teacher. My story has a lot more twists and turns: Moving. Babies. Law School. Divorce. Second marriage. But here’s the bottom line: my education opened a zillion doors for me. That’s why I’m fighting for today’s students to be able to go to school without breaking the bank. I’m deeply grateful for the opportunities I had, and for the chance to help this year’s class of graduates kick off their next chapters. How about we put our heads together on this? Do you have any advice or messages you’d like to share for this year’s graduating class? Please share your advice with me here — I’d love to know what you think.

15,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1037821,Elizabeth Warren,Why are all these big banks dropping like flies?,"May 4, 2023 10:04 PM","It happened again: another big bank failure. Just about two months ago, two major banks crashed — Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. SVB’s collapse was the second-biggest bank failure in American history. But not for long, because First Republic Bank just nose-dived too and took over that #2 slot. Why are these big banks dropping like flies? Well, the news may feel sudden, but the failures have been years in the making. I want to talk about some major causes, and how I’m fighting to fix our banking system. Big-shot bank executives — including leaders at SVB, Signature, and First Republic — lobbied for looser regulations. Under the Trump administration, they got ’em. Regulators at the Fed were asleep at the switch, big banks were free to load up on risk to juice their profits (and bonuses), and the houses of cards came crumbling down. So I’m fighting to pass stronger regulations. I’m fighting to hold regulators accountable. I’m fighting to hold bank executives accountable — including with my bipartisan bill to claw back executive compensation after bank failures. If we toughen up the rules of the road, if we make sure regulators use all the tools in their toolbox to enforce those rules, and if we change the system that currently incentivizes bank executives to chase big risks without consequences for their personal bottom lines, we can put the system on surer footing. Here’s the way I see it: we need a banking system that works for working people. That lets small businesses and nonprofits make deposits with confidence that their money will still be there when they need it. That allows our economy to keep humming along and growing. In fact, banking should be boring — not a thrill-seeking industry where CEOs can gamble with our whole economy. We’re in this fight side by side for a government that works for families — not big banks, billionaire CEOs, and giant corporations. You help make it all possible with your grassroots support. And I’m deeply grateful.

16,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1035657,Elizabeth Warren,"If you’re able, please support the National Network of Abortion Funds today","May 2, 2023 11:06 PM","One year ago today, we learned of the leaked decision suggesting that the Supreme Court was poised to strip away the constitutional right to an abortion. I can remember everything about the moment I found out. I’m sure you can clearly remember, too. I was in my kitchen on the phone with my daughter. We were in the middle of talking about something and she said, “Oh, my God — oh, no, no, no.” I thought, “Oh, dear, one of the grandchildren has been hurt, something’s happened right in front of her.” I kept saying, “What?” And finally she said, “I don’t understand the Supreme Court, they put up an opinion, they’re gonna take back Roe v. Wade.” She obviously was reading her phone while she was talking to me. I started punching on my own phone at the same time. It felt like a full-body smack from the top of your head all the way down to your toes. My mind went back to when I was a girl. I grew up in Oklahoma when abortion was illegal. I saw the harm that was caused. All of that came flooding back. I had thought my daughter and my granddaughters would be protected and have more rights than we did. But the Supreme Court decided they will not. I was so angry then — and I still am. But this extremist court will not get the final word. That was my commitment a year ago when we protested on the steps of the Court — and it still remains my commitment today. I’m continuing the fight for the big, structural changes that will reverse this injustice and prevent it from happening again — like expanding the Supreme Court to rebalance it, electing more anti-filibuster Senators to end this archaic rule and pass national abortion protections, and fixing the Electoral College so popular-vote losers like Donald Trump can’t stack the courts again. And I’m going to continue to support pro-abortion candidates and ballot measures at the state level. It’s clear that when we run on abortion rights, we win on abortion rights — and we must do everything we can to expand abortion protections or defeat attempts to restrict access. But until we get this done, we must continue to look after each other, and help ensure safe, accessible abortions to everyone who needs or wants one. So if you can, please make a donation to the National Network of Abortion Funds, who will help patients across the country still access the abortion care that they need. 100% of your contribution will support this vital organization.

An extremist minority is imposing their unpopular views on the rest of America. But there are ways we can change this — and we must.

Remember: Five justices who ended the right to abortion were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. There are real solutions to the root cause of this crisis, but it’s going to take big ideas — and big, structural changes.

I’m officially running for re-election, and Elizabeth let me send you this note to talk about this campaign. When I ran in 2020, I set out to do three things: Restore the soul of our nation, rebuild the backbone of America — the middle class — and create a government to work for us, rather than against us. Together, we took our economy back from the brink. We took aggressive action to bring costs down for working people — all while making wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. We passed the first federal gun violence prevention legislation in 30 years. We took the strongest action on climate in the world — I’m not kidding. We’ve got a lot of work to do and a lot of progress we’ve got to make in the second term. But we’ve got to finish the job . And I can only do that with you behind me.

They’re a dream team, working together to protect our freedoms, defend our democracy, and put our government on the side of working people. I’m proud to support them. But make no mistake: the path to the 2024 election won’t be easy. MAGA Republicans will stop at nothing to take back the White House. If they win, they’ll further restrict the right to an abortion, the freedom to vote, and protections for trans people. They’ll threaten Social Security and Medicare, reward the rich and powerful, and embolden an extremist base across the country. We’ve got to stop them. Today is a pivotal moment, and we need all hands on deck. To help keep up the fight, can you split a donation of $3 or any amount between the Biden-Harris campaign and my re-election?

During the last election, Americans showed up in record-shattering numbers — even in the middle of a pandemic — to make their voices heard. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won more votes than any candidate in history. A few weeks later, on one of the darkest days of our democracy, a violent mob of domestic terrorists — incited by the president of the United States — attacked the Capitol and tried to overturn the results. This is the type of anti-democratic extremism that we’re still up against. But, in the 2022 midterms, Democrats were able to expand our majority in the Senate, and election deniers lost every statewide race to oversee elections in every presidential battleground — shoring up the freedom of the American people to choose their own leaders in 2024. But that didn’t happen by chance. It’s because we grew a strong grassroots movement across the country to reject authoritarian extremism. To defend our democracy. To protect our freedoms. We can win this next election — and continue to make real change — if we link arms and get organized, person to person, starting now. As a candidate for re-election to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, I’d be honored to appear on the same ballot as President Biden and Vice President Harris next year. And I’m going to do everything I can to see them pull off another big win. If you’re able to, please split a donation of $3 or anything you can today to support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and my re-election campaign.

22,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1026828,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s getting really, really, really old to have to wonder which fundamental freedom the far-right Supreme Court justices are about to dismantle","April 24, 2023 10:41 PM","I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of being kept in suspense to see just how extreme the Supreme Court is about to be. Last spring, we were waiting to see if they’d overturn Roe. Then their opinion came down like a hammer. Last Friday, we were waiting all day to see if they’d let one lower-court judge restrict access to medication abortion across the country. Finally, after 6:30 p.m., they finally announced that they wouldn’t — at least for now. It’s getting really, really, really old to have to wonder which fundamental freedom the far-right justices are about to dismantle. Simply put, a tiny group of far-right radicals are trying to impose their unpopular views on the rest of us for insidious reasons. The American people are losing confidence in the Court by the day. And for good reason, with the Court’s recent ethics scandals and dangerous decisions on abortion rights, climate action, gun safety, and more. They’re anti-union, they’re anti-consumer, and they've empowered corporations more than ever before — giving them religious liberty rights and letting them spend gobs of money to influence the political process. The Court is tossing aside settled law and saying they're just going to substitute their own personal views and make the rest of America bend to it. Pure and simple, a tiny group of far-right radicals are trying to impose their unpopular views on the rest of us for insidious reasons. It deeply troubles me to think how six justices could care so little about the people who will pay the price for their baseless decisions. So now is the time to be angry. And now is the time to channel that anger into action. Let’s remind ourselves the Supreme Court doesn't get the final word. The final word rests with We The People. That’s why I just joined Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley in Boston to help launch the Just Majority Supreme Court accountability campaign. Alongside dozens of partners — including March For Our Lives, NARAL, and Color of Change — we’re calling for a fair and ethical Supreme Court. And we’re fighting to rebalance this hijacked institution by expanding it. Think of it as a democratic recalibration. Congress has already used that power seven times before, and it’s time to use it again. The campaign’s kicking off a 20-city tour. I’m going to stay in the fight, and I’ll keep working to elect more anti-filibuster Democratic senators across the country — because that’s what we need to pass nationwide abortion protections and reverse the Court’s horrifying injustices. And we cannot let Republicans seize any more power. If they do, we’ve already seen their wishlist — and right at top, circled and underlined, is a nationwide ban on abortion. That means no safe havens anywhere. There is still a path out of these attacks on our freedoms. It is not a guaranteed path, but I can guarantee you this: You don't get what you don't fight for. So I’m staying in this fight all the way.

23,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1023093,Elizabeth Warren,Kevin McCarthy is not even hiding it,"April 20, 2023 10:29 PM","Once in a while, Republican politicians put all their cards on the table. That’s exactly what Kevin McCarthy did on Monday. As he celebrated 100 days since (eventually) getting elected House Speaker, he went to the New York Stock Exchange, and he basically told everyone in America to be afraid — to be very afraid. Why? Because he’s willing to crash the economy. He’s demanding job-destroying budget cuts in exchange for avoiding a job-destroying default on the national debt. In other words: Heads he wins, tails the working people of America lose. I’m holding firm for a clean bill to prevent a debt ceiling crisis, just like Kevin McCarthy and Republicans voted to raise the debt ceiling repeatedly under Donald Trump. Let’s link arms on this. Add your name if you agree: Congress must pass a clean bill to avoid a national default without negotiating ANY cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or other programs that serve the American people. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] We’ll keep fighting for a government that works for everyone — not just the rich and powerful — while Kevin McCarthy keeps spreading the out-of-touch Republican gospel to Wall Street bankers. You see, in his speech, he was laying out a dangerous vision, where working people pay to keep our country running while corporations pay as little as possible in taxes. Where Republicans slash funding that supports working families while making the IRS government look the other way as the ultra-rich cheat on their taxes. Where hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions, of Americans lose their jobs — the jobs they’re counting on to make rent, to pay the mortgage, to put food on the table — while CEOs laugh all the way to the bank. And if he doesn’t get his way on making that vision a reality, he’s willing to flush the global economy down the toilet by triggering the first-ever default on our debt — by not paying the tab he and Donald Trump ran up with massive tax breaks for billionaires and giant corporations.

24,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1020452,Elizabeth Warren,How was your weekend?,"April 18, 2023 5:00 PM","Can I let you in on a secret? Tax prep corporations like Turbotax and H&R Block don’t want you to know this — but you could be filing your taxes for free and without all the hassle. Let me break it down: Every year, when your W2s and 1099s come in the mail, your employer has already sent a copy to the government. So it’s no secret: They already know how much you make before you file your taxes. So instead of all the scrambling, calculating, complicated questions, and late nights (did I just describe your weekend?), the IRS could simply send you a pre-filled tax form based on information they already have. You’d confirm the information, and send it back. A free filing system would take the headache — and the expense — out of doing your taxes. And yet, the tax filing process takes Americans an average of 13 hours and $200. Because tax prep companies have spent decades, and tens of millions of dollars, lobbying Washington to make tax filing as much of a hassle as possible. All so they can maximize profits by reeling in frustrated taxpayers, often with misleading marketing that steers people away from free options. I’ve been ringing the bell on this issue for years, and last year, Democrats passed funding that brings us closer to free, streamlined federal tax filing. But Washington needs to continue to hear that the American people are demanding action. Add your name to say you’re in this fight for a free, easy tax filing system. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] So why hasn’t it already been done? Well, Republicans have sided with the giant tax prep companies, demanding that the IRS stops “competing” with private companies. Oh brother. So these corporations brokered a deal — a deal that was good for them, and lousy for us. They promised to offer low-income Americans free tax prep software, and in exchange, the IRS wouldn’t make a free filing program of their own, for everyone. Since then, H&R Block and Intuit (the owner of TurboTax) undermined their own free filing options: Hiding them from search engine results and using slick designs and upsell tactics to trick clients into paying more. Because let’s be clear: These flimsy, free options were never meant to be easy or useful. The consequence? Tax filing is now a billion-dollar industry in the United States. And — I hope you’re sitting down for this — free filing has been implemented in many other countries. We are WAY behind. But there’s hope to turn the tide. I fought to increase funding to move the IRS closer to offering a free, easy-to-use tax filing service — and we passed it last year. We have the tools to do this now, and the benefits would be huge. We just need to fight for it, side by side, to keep up the pressure and make sure we get free tax filing over the finish line. Add your name to say you’re in this fight. As a grassroots movement, we can beat the corporate tax prep lobby.

25,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1017630,Elizabeth Warren,Nevada,"April 15, 2023 1:05 PM","I’ll give you a quick heads-up: You’re going to be seeing plenty of headlines about Nevada’s 2024 Senate race. Nevada is as swingy as swing-states come these days. After all, just last year, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto won it by less than 1 percent — less than 10,000 votes. Senator Jacky Rosen is up for re-election next year. Republicans will dump buckets of money into the state to try to flip this seat, take back the Senate, and push their extreme, far-right agenda. We’ve got to stop them. Can you split a donation of $3 or any amount between Jacky Rosen and me to support both of our 2024 re-election campaigns? You’ll help make sure Democrats hold onto the Senate, and you’ll help re-elect a champion for Nevada families. [[link removed]] If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process automatically: DONATE NOW: $3 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $15 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $28 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $50 [[link removed]] DONATE NOW: $100 [[link removed]] OTHER AMOUNT [[link removed]] > When I first met Jacky Rosen, I knew she had the fight in her to do something great. She hasn’t had anything handed to her. She worked as a cocktail waitress to help put herself through college, and when she started as a computer programmer, she worked as a banquet waitress on the side to pay the bills. Now she’s a force to be reckoned with in Washington — fighting for affordable health care, protections for Nevada’s beautiful natural environment (a place Bruce and I love to go hiking), and more. She’s also committed to fighting for the right to an abortion. Just one example: After right-wing extremists on the Supreme Court overturned Roe, we called on the Department of Veterans Affairs to start offering abortion care — and they began offering abortion services. I’d be very happy to continue serving alongside her. And we can’t let her be replaced by a member of the anti-abortion rights, corporation-coddling, Social-Security-and-Medicare-threatening GOP. But she’s going to have a hard-fought re-election race in Nevada. Last year, this team came together and pitched in to re-elect Catherine Cortez Masto. It was incredible, and it helped protect and expand our Democratic majority. Now let’s come together and pitch in to re-elect another great Democratic woman senator from Nevada. If you’re able to support Jacky Rosen today, you’ll be getting in on the ground floor of the next big competitive Senate race. And every time you see another headline about how it’s a toss-up, you’ll know you made a contribution early — when it could go the furthest to help plan for the rest of the campaign. Please pitch in with a split donation to Jacky Rosen and my re-election campaigns — and let’s win these races side by side.

26,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1014430,Elizabeth Warren,They want us to tune out. I’m not going to. And I hope you won’t either.,"April 12, 2023 3:40 PM","I first ran for office because I’d studied how the system was rigged against hardworking people, and I wanted to do something about it. I’m running for re-election because while we’ve made tremendous progress together, we’ve still got some serious challenges ahead of us. The governor of Idaho just signed an extreme “abortion trafficking” bill into law — restricting residents from traveling for abortions in states where it's legal. Two Black lawmakers in Tennessee were expelled from the state House last week for peacefully protesting against gun violence following a horrific mass shooting in Nashville. Anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is popping up all over, threatening the right to health care, expression, and safety for trans, gender-nonconforming, and nonbinary people. Our judiciary system has been hijacked by the far-right, and these institutions continue to give the public more and more reason to lose trust. The latest example? I could bring up how a federal judge in Texas just ruled to reverse the FDA’s approval of mifepristone — ​​one of the most common methods of abortion. Or, I could go with the recent revelation that Justice Clarence Thomas has been accepting undisclosed luxury trips from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow. (Both of these examples occurred in the past week.) Look: I won’t sugarcoat what we’re up against. Our values and rights are under siege from powerful interests. The gun lobby. Anti-abortion radicals. Big Pharma. Fossil fuel giants. Right-wing extremists. All using their deep pockets to block change. All hoping that we’ll get so frustrated we just tune out. Yeah, right. I’m going to keep doing everything in my power to stand up to these extremists and fight for the bold, systemic change we need to protect our democracy and our values. If you’re able to, please pitch in $3 or anything you can to our re-election campaign to help continue this fight.

We can end the filibuster, pass a national law protecting abortion rights across the country, and expand the Supreme Court to rebalance this hijacked institution and prevent more damage from being done. We can pass my Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act to give Americans confidence that their judges are held to the highest ethical standards and are free from conflicts of interest. We can continue mobilizing across the country and provide resources for critical local downballot races, ensuring that pro-democracy candidates are leading the charge to protect our rights and election integrity in the states. Real change doesn't just happen because of decisions made in Washington. It happens because people all across the country get into the fight — pushing from the outside while elected officials work on the inside. I'll keep up the fight in the Senate, but I'm counting on you to stay in the fight, too. If you believe that these are the types of fights our elected leaders should be taking on, please pitch in $3 or anything you can to fuel this re-election campaign. I’m so grateful for your support.

27,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1011894,Elizabeth Warren,About Clarence Thomas,"April 9, 2023 10:50 PM","Public trust in the Supreme Court was already at historic lows — and I wouldn’t be surprised if it just keeps getting worse from here. This past week, news broke that Justice Clarence Thomas has been accepting undisclosed luxury travel gifts from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow — full of private jets, superyachts, and exclusive resorts. Look, when someone gets their day in court, they shouldn’t have to wonder whether their judge — or a Supreme Court justice — is looking out for wealthy donors instead of the rule of law. This latest news is just a reminder that the judicial branch needs real ethics reform, from top to bottom. I’ve got a plan for that — the Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act. From banning federal judges from owning individual stocks to overhauling the broken judicial recusal process, this bill would help root out corruption and restore public trust in the federal judiciary. But we have to fight side by side — as a grassroots movement — to get these reforms through Congress. I’ll keep fighting to root corruption out of our federal judiciary, and I need you in this fight with me. Please add your name if you agree: Judges must follow a basic, binding code of ethics in order to sit on the bench. [[link removed]] Simply put, corruption is toxic to our democracy. Here are a few big pieces of how this bill would give Americans confidence that their judges are held to the highest ethical standards and are free from conflicts of interest: - Banning federal judges from owning individual stocks and certain other investments. - Strengthening restrictions on judicial gifts and privately funded travel. - Imposing the existing Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges on the Supreme Court — the only court in the country not currently subject to a binding ethical code. - Improving disclosure of judicial speeches and case assignments, while mandating the livestreaming of court proceedings. - Closing the loophole that allows judges to escape accountability by retiring from the bench, strengthening disciplinary authority for the Judicial Conference, setting up expedited impeachment procedures for federal judges, and allowing the public to file complaints against Supreme Court Justices — like all other federal judges — through a new Supreme Court Complaints Review Committee. - Limiting the ability of courts to seal records that contain important information for the protection of public health or safety, often concealed at the urging of massive corporations. Beyond this bill, there’s more we can do to restore faith in an independent judiciary committed to the rule of law. I’ve been pushing to expand the Supreme Court by four or more seats to rebalance this institution that’s been hijacked by right-wing extremists. But let’s make progress by tackling corruption. There’s real momentum behind the judicial ethics reform. But now we need to show that the American people are raising their voices on this. Will you add your name to say you support our Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act? Make your voice heard on this issue that is powerfully important to our democracy.

28,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1010132,Elizabeth Warren,re: Tennessee,"April 7, 2023 5:10 PM","What’s happening in Tennessee right now is infuriating. After the horrific act of gun violence that happened in Nashville, voters and gun violence prevention advocates protested at the Tennessee state House to urge their lawmakers to finally pass meaningful gun reform. Three House representatives — Justin Jones, Justin J. Pearson, and Gloria Johnson — joined the protest. The Republican-controlled House voted to punish the three lawmakers by stripping their committee assignments. And last night, they voted to expel Rep. Jones and Rep. Pearson — two Black men — from the House. Special elections will be held soon to fill their seats — and they both have the chance to run again. So, let’s make sure they have the resources they need to win, stay in office, and keep up the fight for gun safety legislation. If you’re able please split a contribution between Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson right now. 100% of your contribution will support their campaigns.

Instead of responding to a mass shooting with meaningful action that will protect our children and our communities, they’re focused on silencing and expelling two Black men who are rightfully sounding the alarm on this issue — and silencing the people of Tennessee, too. This is not what democracy looks like — and we must fight back. We desperately need both Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson’s voices in this fight.

29,https://politicalemails.org/messages/1008281,Elizabeth Warren,Two reminders from last night,"April 5, 2023 10:53 PM","Just in case you needed a reminder that when we work together, we win together — here are TWO: 1.  Brandon Johnson just got elected mayor of Chicago — a major progressive victory against entrenched special interests — even though he got dramatically outspent on TV ads. 2. Judge Janet Protasiewicz just flipped a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and secured a brand-new majority that’s pro-abortion rights, anti-gerrymandering, and pro-voting rights. How did these campaigns win? By getting organized at the grassroots level. By making it clear who they were fighting for. By running on popular, urgent, progressive issues, like ensuring access to a great public education for every child in Chicago and protecting the right to an abortion across Wisconsin. I was very happy to fight by their side, and I’m running for re-election to the Senate to keep fighting for big, bold action for working people. If you’re ready to keep working together and winning together, and if a donation would make sense for you right now, please chip in $3 or any amount — and help build our grassroots movement. [[link removed]] We win — and we make real change — when we link arms and get organized, person to person. It’s how we beat Wall Street to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s how we defied the naysayers and got student loan debt cancellation to President Biden’s desk. It’s how we defeated corporate lobbyists and passed a new tax on massive corporate profits. And it’s how we’re going to keep delivering results for families across the country. But it’s only possible if we work alongside each other.

35,https://politicalemails.org/messages/999126,Elizabeth Warren,What your donation would mean today,"March 28, 2023 12:23 AM","I just officially announced that I’m running for re-election in 2024. I never in a zillion years thought I'd be a U.S. senator. But my life has had a lot of twists and turns, just like a lot of people's. I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class. After my daddy’s heart attack, my family came within an inch from losing our house, but my mother got a minimum wage job at Sears that saved our family. I dropped out of college at 19 to get married, but got a second chance at a public college that cost $50 a semester and got to live my dream of becoming a public school teacher. I’ve dedicated my career to studying why families go broke and fighting to rebuild the middle class. After Wall Street crashed our economy in 2008, I fought to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect people from getting scammed by big banks and corporations. The CFPB has already returned more than $16 billion to American consumers who’ve been cheated. After Senate Republicans vowed to block my nomination to serve as the CFPB’s first director, I went back home to Massachusetts and ran against one of them — and I beat him. I ran to tax greedy corporations, to invest in jobs and our infrastructure, and to rein in student loan companies. And guess what? We got it all done. But the fight to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — isn’t over. So I’m running for re-election to keep up the fight. Will you make a contribution of $5, $15, or whatever you can today and become a Founding Donor of this campaign so I can keep fighting for working families in the Senate? [[link removed]] DONATE NOW [[link removed]] Throughout my time in Washington, I’ve learned that when you start talking about policies that help working people instead of wealthy people or big corporations, plenty of critics will be quick to tell you what you can’t do and what’s not possible. It’s like clockwork. Take student loan cancellation for example. Cynics said we could never put our government on the side of working-class and middle-class people who fought to get an education and are getting crushed by debt. But we got organized, we got in the fight, and we got this policy to the president’s desk. I’ll stay in the fight to get student debt cancellation over the finish line. Because that’s a case where we still see how the rules work differently for different groups of people: Right now we have a system that holds millions of struggling student loan borrowers in limbo, but that same system worked overnight to ensure that billion-dollar crypto firms wouldn’t lose a dime in deposits during the recent bank failures. The difference between these two scenarios? The willingness to fight for them. I’m in this fight all the way — and I am going to continue to use my voice to advocate for big, structural changes that help working people. I need you by my side in this fight. A contribution of $3 or anything you can will help show the naysayers that our plans — like taxing the rich, reining in big banks, and making child care affordable — have strong support. Will you please pitch in today to support my re-election and make these plans possible? The amount of grassroots contributions we receive today will help demonstrate the strength of our movement — and any amount makes a powerful difference.

37,https://politicalemails.org/messages/998283,Elizabeth Warren,A big announcement from me,"March 27, 2023 11:24 AM","I’m making it official today, and I wanted you to hear it from me: I’m running for re-election to the U.S. Senate next year. Together, we’ve won some big battles for working families in Massachusetts and across the country. But there’s plenty more to do. So I’m staying in the fight. And I’m asking if you’ll be a part of this new campaign from Day One: Can you make a donation of $15, or any amount that makes sense right now, to become a Founding Donor for our re-election campaign? You’ve helped power our movement, and I’d be deeply grateful to have your support as I take on this new righteous fight. [[link removed]] I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the wealthy and well-connected and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it too. And even though we’ve been up against powerful forces, the past ten years have shown us that when we organize, fight righteous fights, and hold those in power accountable, we can make positive change, including: - Getting student loan debt cancelation to President Biden’s desk - Passing a new tax on massive corporate profits - Lowering the cost of hearing aids - Pressuring Wells Fargo executives into resigning after their fake accounts scandal - Supporting infrastructure projects from the Berkshires to New Bedford - Even making billionaires cry on national TV - Now I’m running to keep representing Massachusetts because there’s a lot more we’ve got to do. Pass a wealth tax. Make child care affordable. - Ensure the right to an abortion. Protect consumers from big banks. Protect our Commonwealth’s coastal communities from climate emergencies. - Build a 21st-century transportation system across all of Massachusetts. Make our government work for everyone, not just a thin slice at the top. We’re going to build this new campaign the same way we’ve built all our campaigns: from the grassroots level. Because with a grassroots-funded movement, we can fight back against extremist Republicans and powerful interests like Big Pharma, Big Oil, and big banks who use their deep pockets to try to block change. Please make a donation if you can today, and become a Founding Donor. Every contribution, no matter how big or small, adds up and helps show that there’s strong support for our plans and our values. Side by side, let’s rebuild the middle class, root corruption out of Washington, and strengthen our democracy.

38,https://politicalemails.org/messages/995302,Elizabeth Warren,"Government regulations are, in fact, a good thing.","March 23, 2023 4:51 PM","Have you ever thought about how you don’t need to be an appliance expert to know which toasters are safe to buy? That’s thanks to government regulations. And in the same vein, you shouldn’t need to be a banking expert to know which banks are safe to put your money in. Let me back up a bit and explain why I’m comparing banks to toasters. When I was a young mom, toaster ovens had an on-off switch, and that was it. They could too easily start fires and burn down families’ houses. Then along came a federal agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which stepped in and said manufacturers had to add features like a timer and automatic shut-off. This simple change made toasters a whole lot safer. Thirty years later, while working on an article about how the government could protect consumers from predatory financial companies, I thought about those old toaster ovens. By then, it was all but impossible to buy a toaster that had a one-in-five chance of exploding. A government agency monitored toasters for basic safety, just like the government kept lead paint out of children’s toys and rat poison out of medicine. But it was possible to refinance a home with a mortgage that had a one-in-five chance of costing a family their home and putting them out on the street. In fact, it wasn’t just possible: Those mortgages were wreaking havoc all over the country. I had a plan for how we could change the rules with a structural fix: A new government agency whose sole mission was to look out for consumers. They could serve as the watchdog to make sure that financial companies followed some clear, commonsense rules. No tricks hidden in the fine print, no traps buried in complex legalese. Then the crash of 2008 happened. Millions of people lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. And maybe one of the most galling parts was that the Wall Street megabanks whose recklessness helped crash the economy weren't ashamed. Nope. Just the opposite. The plan didn’t seem so pie-in-the-sky anymore. So we got organized and started fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Of course, the giant financial institutions were dead set against an agency whose job was to get the tricks and traps out of the fine print of financial products. They spent millions lobbying against financial reform and the new consumer agency. It was David-versus-Goliath all the way. But we won. The CFPB transformed the market for financial services by placing new rules on mortgages, credit cards, checking accounts, prepaid cards, and payday loans to clean up some of the most predatory practices and knock bad actors out of the industry altogether. And since it’s been created, this little agency has returned about $16 billion to American consumers who’ve been cheated. The CFPB is just one example of how government regulations are — in fact — a good thing. For toasters, and for financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank handling over $50 billion in assets. Now, of course special interests keep trying to roll back regulations and strangle the CFPB. Of course they don’t want anyone looking over their shoulder as they cheat people. Of course they’d rather have free rein to boost their profits by putting our whole economy at risk. But they don’t get the last word. I’m fighting back for the protections that Americans need — and I’m grateful you’re in this fight by my side. If you can, please make a donation today — of $3 or any amount — to help power our fight.

In Wisconsin, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz is running for an open seat in the state Supreme Court — which has been under conservative control for years. Judge Protasiewicz is a respected judge and devoted community leader. And if she wins, progressives would have a majority and could protect abortion rights, defend voting rights, and reverse extreme gerrymandering. I’ll just be blunt: The 2024 presidential election could also be at stake. The Wisconsin Supreme Court was just one vote away from siding with Donald Trump to throw out thousands of votes in 2020. We’ve got to elect Janet Protasiewicz to help secure our democracy. But she’s up against a MAGA extremist supported by anti-abortion groups, billionaire donors, and election deniers — and we need to fight back with as much grassroots support possible.

Part of it means stronger laws. Part of it means tougher oversight. But deterring this kind of risky behavior also means making sure the people responsible for it don’t get rewarded. You see, bank executives had dollar signs in their eyes when they successfully lobbied for weaker regulations in the Trump era. With less rules and oversight, they juiced their salaries and their bonuses by taking on more and more risk in the short-term. Their get-rich-quick scheme worked great — until the banks exploded last week. Let’s take Greg Becker of SVB for instance. He took home $9.9 million in compensation last year, including a $1.5 million bonus for boosting bank profitability — and its riskiness. And there’s Joseph DePaolo of Signature Bank, who got $8.6 million in the same year. Even last Friday, just hours before the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation rushed to take over SVB, executives were busy paying out congratulatory bonuses — leaving countless businesses and non‌profits with accounts at the bank alarmed that they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills and employees. We should claw all of that pay and bonuses back, and prosecutors and regulators should investigate whether any executives engaged in insider trading ‌or broke other civil or criminal laws. Add your name if you agree. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] Make no mistake: If those executives walk away with millions of dollars for running their banks into the ground — for gambling with the survival of small businesses, nonprofits, and the health of our economy — it’ll be a big, blazing neon sign encouraging other bank CEOs to run the same playbook. The executives responsible for the recent bank failures must face legal and financial consequences — and we must bring back strong banking regulations in order to prevent the next crisis. This past week, I wrote letters to the ex-CEOs of SVB and Signature Bank, asking for details on SVB’s last-minute bonuses, as well as all the compensation and bonuses the executives received in the past 10 years, what specific metrics they met to earn those bonuses, and whether they got any bonuses for successfully lobbying to limit regulation of SVB and Signature. Look, when Wall Street greed crashed our economy and destroyed millions of lives in the 2008 financial crisis, bankers walked away with multi-million-dollar bonuses. It was outrageous. Now we’re watching this start to unfold again. I’m fighting so that these Big Bank executives can’t continue getting away with this. Add your name if you agree: The executives responsible for these bank failures should not be rewarded — and must be held accountable.

We can’t just wait for an even bigger bank failure before taking action. The banking industry needs to follow stronger rules ASAP. And I’ve proposed a bill with Congresswoman Katie Porter to get this done. This legislation repeals a key piece of Trump's bill, which eased regulations on banks that controlled assets ranging from $50 billion to $250 billion. I don’t know about you, but to me a minimum of $50 billion in assets is not pocket change, and needs to be strongly regulated. Add your name if you agree: We must restore the strong bank regulations that were undone by Donald Trump in order to protect our economy and prevent another financial crisis. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME Here’s the way I see it: banking should be boring. It should never involve this kind of high-stakes theatrics, especially when the livelihoods of so many are involved. And anyone who wants to take on a lot of risk to make a lot of money quickly should not be in banking. Trump’s bill made it easier for banks to load up on risk to boost their profits without being subject to enhanced capital requirements and stress tests to prevent a collapse. We need to go back to better regulation to make banking more boring again. We’ve got to fight for this right now.

42,https://politicalemails.org/messages/986211,Elizabeth Warren,I wish I had been wrong,"March 13, 2023 11:51 PM","I wish I’d been wrong. Five years ago, I warned that deregulating banks would have dangerous consequences. And in the past few days, we’ve seen those consequences of a deregulated system unfold with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In other words the banks are reaping what they sowed. Let’s back up a little, and talk about how we got here: After Wall Street crashed our economy and destroyed millions of livelihoods in the 2008 financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to strengthen protections for consumers and make sure that history wouldn’t repeat itself. Wall Street executives and their lobbyists weren’t happy with it (no surprise), and they’ve been trying to chip away at it ever since. In 2018, high-powered bank executives were calling on Congress to weaken Dodd-Frank so their banks could slip out of those stronger oversight rules. One of those executives? Greg Becker. The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). I raised the alarm and fought hard against these changes, but the banks won that battle. Donald Trump signed a bill into law that rolled back key parts of Dodd-Frank. Regulators, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, took the situation from bad to worse by letting financial institutions load up on more and more risk with less and less oversight. The collapses of SVB and Signature Bank are direct results of a toxic mix of risky management and weak supervision. -SVB relied on a concentrated group of tech companies with big deposits. With such high concentration in a single sector of the economy, any weakness in that sector could undermine the bank’s stability. -Instead of managing that risk, SVB funneled their clients’ deposits into long-term bonds, making it hard for the bank to respond quickly to changing circumstances. This model was great for short-term profits, which shot up by nearly 40 ‌percent over the last three years‌ — but now we know its cost. -When things were looking especially bad last week, more of SVB's customers withdrew their deposits — causing a mad dash and, ultimately, a collapse that left many businesses alarmed that they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills and employees (but as the collapse unfolded, SVB executives rushed to pay out congratulatory bonuses). If Congress and the Federal Reserve hadn’t rolled back parts of Dodd-Frank, these banks would have been subject to stronger requirements to withstand financial shocks. And they would have been required to conduct regular stress tests to expose their vulnerabilities. But here we are. And last night, regulators announced that all vaporized deposits would be repaid in full. Even for billion-dollar companies, crypto investors, and the very venture capital firms that triggered the SVB bank run in the first place. (I can’t help but point out that it’s no wonder the American people are skeptical of a system that holds millions of struggling student loan borrowers in limbo but steps in overnight to ensure that billion-dollar crypto firms won’t lose a dime in deposits.) Washington must act quickly to prevent another crisis. Here’s what I’m calling for: 1. Reverse the dangerous bank deregulation of the Trump era. Congress must repeal the 2018 law right away. And bank regulators must ensure stronger oversight, taking a careful look under the hood at our financial institutions to see where other dangers might be lurking. 2. Reform deposit insurance. Large companies with billions in unsecured deposits should never again expect, or receive, free support from the government. Regulators should act so businesses affected by bank failures like these are fully covered when they’re trying to make payroll and do other ordinary financial transactions. And the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk should pay for it. 3. Deter this risky behavior by making sure it’s not rewarded. Executives at SVB and Signature — who made millions of dollars — need to be held accountable. That includes clawing back their bonuses. And it also means investigating whether they engaged in insider trading or any other unlawful activity. This was completely avoidable. I’ll keep advocating strong banking regulations — just like I have for years — and I will work to keep banks like SVB from doing even more damage. And I’m grateful that you’re in this movement alongside me. You make it possible to keep up the fight.

43,https://politicalemails.org/messages/984869,ElizabethWarren.com,"Elizabeth is taking on big corporations, and it’s getting attention:","March 12, 2023 1:01 PM","Here’s a column headline that recently caught our eye, from Reuters: Reuters: Elizabeth Warren leads cavalry into deal battles The column highlights how Elizabeth has successfully encouraged federal agencies to use all their tools to challenge big, harmful corporate mergers — mergers that can lead to lower wages, higher prices, worse service, and a less competitive economy: “[Suing to stop Jetblue from buying Spirit Airlines] would be the third curious regulatory intervention in recent weeks, each encouraged by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. The cases speak to how President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing its consolidation crackdown to new extremes.” Of course, if you want to talk about “extremes,” there’s this: for decades, regulators took their hands off the wheel and allowed corporate concentration to reach extreme heights. From the airline industry to grocery stores to agribusinesses to Big Tech to Ticketmaster, a smaller number of giants gained more and more power, and they’ve used that power to stomp on working people and consumers. Big problems require big solutions, and that’s Elizabeth’s speciality. She’s fighting back against corporate concentration — and the Biden-Harris administration has stepped up to the plate, appointing strong officials and taking action against corporate monopolies. Here’s what the column said about how Elizabeth is helping to change the game for merger-hungry corporations: “As the senator charges up the competition cavalry, dealmakers may have to redraw their battle plans.” If you’re glad that Elizabeth is in this fight against corporate monopolies, and if a financial contribution would make sense for you right now, help keep her in the ring with a donation of $3 or any amount.

44,https://politicalemails.org/messages/982746,Elizabeth Warren,Both of these options are awful,"March 9, 2023 10:42 PM","You may be seeing a lot of headlines about the debt ceiling and budget plans — so I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand. House Republicans are manufacturing a debt ceiling crisis to try to wedge us between a rock and a hard place: Option #1: Default on the national debt, trigger a recession, and throw 1 million Americans out of work. Option #2: Cut key government programs, trigger a recession, and throw 2.6 million Americans out of work. In other words: Heads, they win. Tails, we lose. Both outcomes would hit working people like a kick in the teeth. And both outcomes could cause enough damage to pave the way for Republicans to take back the White House in 2024. But look: There’s no reason we have to play the GOP’s game here. Add your name if you agree  : We’ve got to pick Door #3 and pass a clean bill to avoid a debt default without making job-destroying cuts. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] You may be wondering where I got those jobs figures from. Well, I asked a top economist to put together a report on the consequences of a debt default AND on the consequences of Republicans’ proposed budget cuts. You see, we’ve heard a lot about the former — and they’re plenty terrifying — but less about the latter, which should also send chills down policymakers’ spines. The economist, Mark Zandi, presented his report to a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing I chaired. We also heard from a Massachusetts child care and early learning provider about how much damage GOP cuts would do to families like the ones she works with. And a tax expert testified about how we could raise trillions in revenue by getting billionaires and giant corporations to pay their fair share. Look: House Republicans aren’t interested in fiscal responsibility — they want hardworking Americans to shoulder the burden of keeping the government up and running while billionaires and large corporations get away with paying as little as possible. The debt ceiling hostage demands that they’re making would cost millions of Americans their jobs and plunge into a recession. That’s a non-starter. I’m going to keep fighting for a clean, responsible bill that avoids a debt default. I’ll keep making sure policymakers hear about the human consequences of things like budget cuts. And I’ll keep thinking about the millions of Americans who are working hard right now — paying mortgages, making rent, putting food on the table — but would get handed pink slips if House Republicans get their way. I’ll stay in the fight, but I can’t do it alone. Add your name to say you’re fighting alongside me to protect hardworking Americans from the GOP’s debt-ceiling games and devastating proposed cuts.

45,https://politicalemails.org/messages/981711,Elizabeth Warren,What I’m thinking about this International Women’s Day,"March 8, 2023 11:27 PM","It’s International Women’s Day, and I’m thinking about the brave champions who’ve shown us how we can tackle all the righteous fights that lie ahead. American history is chock-full of powerful examples. If you’ve got a minute, I’d like to run through just a few of them. Phillis Wheatley, the first Black woman to publish a book of poetry in America — her imaginative power inspired leaders like George Washington, and she had to stand tall against attacks on her intellect and integrity. Black washerwomen in Atlanta who formed a union and went on strike in 1881, less than two decades after the end of enslavement — they won higher wages and inspired more workers to fight for economic justice. Women at the Everett Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts who went on strike in 1912 — they defeated big businesses, won higher wages, and sparked a movement that increased the pay of hundreds of thousands of other textile workers throughout New England. Frances Perkins, who was driven to keep fighting for workers after witnessing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, where 146 workers (mostly women, mostly immigrants) died in unsafe conditions — she helped pass landmark safety measures and labor laws, became the first woman to serve in the Cabinet, and helped create programs like Social Security as FDR’s Secretary of Labor. Latina janitors in Los Angeles who launched a campaign in the 1980s for higher wages, better benefits, and a seat at the negotiating table — they captured the nation’s attention, mobilized a wide range of allies, took on global corporations, and won. By channeling their determination, we can persist in making the change we need to make. We can call out injustice, and we can fight back. And we’ve got plenty of fights on our hands. Too many women still don’t get equal pay for equal work. Too many women are still locked out of the workforce and denied opportunity because they can’t find quality, affordable child care. Too many women have to choose between taking care of their families and putting food on the table because we still don’t guarantee paid family leave as a nation. Too many trans women — particularly trans women of color — face discrimination and have to live in fear of violence just for being who they are. And for the first time in over half a century, we’re celebrating International Women’s Day in a country that doesn’t protect the right to an abortion nationwide. So today’s a chance to celebrate the trailblazers who’ve made so much progress, and it also calls on us to keep up the fight. That’s exactly what I’m going to do.

46,https://politicalemails.org/messages/975326,Elizabeth Warren,Extremists have hijacked the judiciary,"March 2, 2023 2:58 PM","If you’re wondering how much damage Republican extremists can do through the federal judiciary, just look at three issues bubbling up through the courts right now: One: This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on what should be an open-and-shut case — whether President Biden has the legal authority to cancel student debt. Spoiler alert: He does. Congress wrote it into the HEROES Act, clear as day, that presidents can cancel student debt to respond to major emergencies. Like, oh, let’s say a global pandemic. Donald Trump used the same power when he was president, and we didn’t hear a single peep from any right-wing politicians or judges that it could be illegal. But now that President Biden’s trying to wield that authority to help working-class and middle-class people, GOP elected officials and billionaire-funded interests are suing to stop it. So I elevated stories that illuminate how student debt relief is clearly targeted to help people who are struggling financially from the pandemic. And I went to the Supreme Court steps on the day of oral arguments to say that the justices need to get out of the way, not play politics, and apply the law. As long as they do that, tens of millions of Americans will get some or all of their student debt canceled. But no matter what, I’m staying in the fight. Two: The Supreme Court announced that they’ll consider whether the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is constitutional. Spoiler alert: It is. Year after year, corporate interests have funded desperate lawsuit after desperate lawsuit challenging the CFPB’s structure. All because they don’t want a strong watchdog keeping them from cheating working families. But in case after case, the corporate interests have failed. This one should be no exception. But if the Court ignores over a century of law and historical precedent, and if extreme right-wing justices decide to play politics and rule against the CFPB, it would throw our economy into chaos. You know, the CFPB has already put more than $12 BILLION back in the pockets of people who got cheated by financial institutions. That gives greedy corporations more than 12 billion reasons to stop the CFPB in its tracks. But it also gives us more than 12 billion reasons to fight back. Alongside this grassroots team and a terrific array of labor unions, civil rights groups, consumer advocates, and more, I fought tooth and nail to turn the CFPB from an unlikely idea to a concrete, consumer-protecting reality. And I won’t stop fighting to keep it that way. Three: One single extremist judge down in Texas could ban mifepristone — a medication commonly used for abortions in America — across the entire country. Mifepristone has been approved by the FDA for two decades. It’s been proven to be safe for medication abortions. But any day now, this Trump appointee could wake up, decide that he’s qualified to override the FDA’s scientific judgment, take mifepristone off the market nationwide, and make abortion care even more inaccessible for millions of Americans. Let’s be clear: After the Supreme Court said that abortion rights would be up to the states, we warned that the extremists wouldn’t stop here. They’d threaten reproductive freedom in every corner of the country, even in places like Massachusetts that have strong protections. And that’s exactly what this Trump judge could do with this case. But we won’t be out of options, no matter how he rules. After the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, I called on the Biden-Harris administration to expand access to medication abortion. They’re already taking action, and they have more tools they can use to keep protecting the right to an abortion. Now, notice what all three of these cases have in common: The danger that right-wing judges and justices could decide to substitute their own judgment for the judgment of elected officials and qualified experts. Extremists have hijacked the judiciary, and they’re using it to advance a far-right agenda that they’d never be able to pass through Congress. They’re using it to rig the rules even more in favor of the rich and powerful, and they’re using it to rip away our freedoms. But I’m fighting back, and I’m grateful you’re in this fight too. We can stay in the fight, no matter how these right-wing extremists rule. We can rebalance the Supreme Court by expanding it. We can use every possible tool to ensure relief for borrowers, protection for consumers, and reproductive freedom for all — including finally passing a bill to codify Roe v. Wade. It’s all possible, as long as we all fight side by side. If it makes sense right now, can you pitch in $3 to support our campaign and help grow our movement?

But the GOP doesn’t seem to agree. Congressional Republicans have kicked off the year by scheming to cut Social Security and Medicare, proposing a nationwide 30 percent sales tax on everything from groceries to gasoline, and threatening to crash our whole economy by not raising the debt ceiling. In other words, they’re working hard to make things a whole lot harder for working-class and middle-class families and our seniors — when so many are still recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. And, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Republicans across the country are plotting to pass bills that take rights away from trans people, make it harder to access FDA-approved abortion medication nationwide, and control what our educators can teach at school. Democrats are fighting back, but if Republicans gain more power in 2024 — and they’re strategizing on how to do that right now — they’d have more free reign to pass their extremist agenda. Can you pitch in $3 today ahead of tomorrow’s grassroots fundraising deadline to support our progressive movement, fund our re-election, and help elect Warren Democrats up and down the ballot?

From the future of our climate to the survival of our democracy, so much is at stake if Republicans seize more power, and we must stop them. And we can — with a grassroots movement powered by grassroots donors. Every single donation helps strengthen this team so we can win back the House and expand our Senate majority with true champions for working people. And every single donation brings us closer to hitting our fundraising goals — including the one we've got to hit by midnight tomorrow. Can you pitch in $3 or whatever makes sense before tomorrow’s monthly grassroots fundraising deadline? Your donation will power our re-election campaign and help elect more unapologetic fighters across the country.

48,https://politicalemails.org/messages/970263,Elizabeth Warren,A heart bigger than the state of Montana,"February 25, 2023 3:03 PM","In a moment, I’m going to ask if you can make a split donation to support Jon Tester and his critical re-election campaign in Montana. But first, I want to take a moment to talk about why it’s so important to support this race early on. Democrats expanded our Senate majority (woo-hoo for John Fetterman, Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Mark Kelly, and everyone who supported their close races). But it’s still just about as slim as can be. The GOP is already working to win back control in 2024, and they’ve drawn big red circles around Montana on the map. We’ve got to fight back — now. Early grassroots donations grew our Democratic majority in 2022, and early grassroots donations will protect our Democratic majority in 2024. So, can you chip in $3 or anything you can to support my friend and colleague Jon Tester in Montana and our re-election campaign? [[link removed]] While we celebrate our hard-fought victories, we’ve got to get to work delivering more results for working families. And to get it done, we need to keep Jon Tester in the Senate. Jon Tester’s always reminded me of my big brothers (not just because of the flat top haircut). He’s tough as nails, he’s got a heart bigger than the state of Montana, and he centers every decision on the needs of working people — because he understands those needs down to his bones. He’s the only working farmer in the Senate, and he and his wife, Sharla, work on the same land that his grandparents tended more than 100 years ago. He is the best person to represent Montanans and working families in Congress, and it’s important to ensure he has the resources he needs to win. We need to invest now to keep our majority because if the GOP takes over, they’ll derail the progress we’re making. They’ll drive an agenda chock-full of goodies for their rich donors and pain for struggling families. They’ll rip away more and more of our freedoms and threaten more and more of our democracy. Let’s make sure Jon can kick off his critical campaign with the strongest momentum possible. Please split $3 or anything you can between our campaigns now to help keep up the fight for working people in the Senate.

49,https://politicalemails.org/messages/969592,Elizabeth Warren,re: Ticketmaster,"February 24, 2023 8:21 PM","Have you had a hard time buying concert tickets lately? Has someone you know been struggling trying to see their favorite artist? From Taylor Swift to Bad Bunny to Beyoncé and beyond, when musicians go on tour, their fans usually have to go through one company. A company that keeps botching the process and making people pay through the nose. A company called Ticketmaster. Now, you know me — when I see a story like this, I think about concentrated corporate power. So do you mind if I nerd out for a minute? For decades now, the federal government has taken a hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement. Giant corporations have been allowed to buy out their competitors. They’ve been able to gain monopoly or near-monopoly power. And because they’re just about the only game in town, they’ve been able to hurt workers with lower wages and hurt consumers with higher prices, worse service, or both. Exhibit A: In 2010, the government let Live Nation, a huge concert-promoting company, buy Ticketmaster, a huge concert-ticket-selling company. Together, they became a one-two punch of market dominance. And they’ve been pummeling fans, artists, and venues in the jaw ever since. But here’s the thing: The federal government has the power to re-examine mergers like Live Nation’s purchase of Ticketmaster, break them up, and restore competition in the marketplace. With high prices and terrible service, Ticketmaster shows the danger of corporate concentration. I’ve been calling to break up big monopolies, and the Biden-Harris administration is taking action, but we need to fight side by side as a grassroots movement to defeat powerful corporate interests. Add your name to say you’re in this fight. [[link removed]] ADD YOUR NAME [[link removed]] Of course, corporate concentration goes way beyond concert tickets — it’s infested our entire economy. Big agribusinesses are crushing family farmers and jacking up prices for consumers. Big tech companies are elbowing out startups and using our private information for profit. Big airlines are getting away with higher fares for lower-quality service. Pure and simple, the American people are suffering under the thumb of corporations that are just too big and too powerful. I’ll keep calling on the administration to use all of its tools to fight back against corporate monopolies. I’ve also got a bill — the Prohibiting Anticompetitive Mergers Act — to ban the biggest, most competition-crushing mergers, restore competition, and bring down prices for consumers. I’ll stay in the fight — but it’s only possible because I’ve got people like you fighting alongside me. Add your name if you agree: It’s time to take on big corporate monopolies and level the playing field so they can’t get away with ridiculously high prices and ridiculously crummy service.
